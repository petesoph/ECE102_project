Here is a helpful guide for using the HADES terminal:

Main menu:
    Within the main menu, you will find 8 total options (0-7).
    Let's explore these now!
    
    (You will also find the current alarm state status, 0 or
    1, at the bottom of the main menu page. More on this in
    Option 6).
    
0) Exit
    This option quits the HADES terminal. Don't fret, though,
    as I (HADES) will remember which lights you left on.
    
        Summary: Quits terminal, saves light data.
        
1) Check Sensors
    This option displays a menu of all sensors within your
    prison, and whether they are each currently armed.
    Finished reviewing the data? You can press any key to 
    return to the main menu!

        Summary: Displays sensors data submenu
        
2) Trigger Sensors
    If the alarm is armed, this option allows you to test the
    reliability of each sensor by triggering the alarm upon
    activation of a chosen sensor.
    
    To choose a sensor, you will be prompet to enter the ID
    of the sensor. Don't worry! A list of options will be
    provided to you. * A note: you must enter the character
    ':' after the sensor ID. That is, enter 'Windows:', not
    'Windows'.
    
    Upon choosing a sensor to test, if all is running smoothly,
    you will be asked if you are sure to set the alarm off. 
    Enter 'Y' or 'y' to continue with the process.
    
    Lastly, if the alarm is NOT armed, you will be told that
    you must first arm the alarm. After all, if the alarm is
    off, there is nothing to trigger!
    
    You will then be returned to the main menu.
    
        Summary: Triggers alarm via individual sensors
                 of users choosing. Alarm must be armed.

3) Check lights
    This option displays a menu of all lights within your
    prison, and whether they are each currently on/off.
    Finished reviewing the status of your lights? You can
    press any key to return to the main menu!

        Summary: Displays lights data submenu
        
4) Turn lights off/on
    This option allows you to choose which lights within
    the prison you would like to have on or off!
    
    To choose a light, you will be prompet to enter the name
    of the light. Don't worry! A list of options will be
    provided to you. * A note: you must enter the character
    ':' after the light name. That is, enter 'Main Light:', not
    'Main Light'.
    
    Depending on the previous status of the light, you will be
    asked if you would like to change the status. Enter 'Y' or
    'y' to proceed with the action. You can always check in with
    Option 3 to remember the status of all your lights.
    
    You will then be returned to the main menu.
    
        Summary: Changes individual light status.

5) Arm/disarm alarm
    This option both provides you with the current status of the
    alarm system, and then asks if you would like to change that
    status.
    
    If the alarm is disarmed, and you would like arm the alarm,
    you will be prompted to re-enter the passcode you entered to
    gain access to the main menu. Doing this will arm all sensors
    (changing their status to 1). Conversely, disarming the alarm
    will disarm all sensors (including the alarm - more on this 
    below). Be careful not to mess up too many times on the 
    password entry!
    
    Once the alarm is armed (and thus the sensors), you will gain
    access to the features of Option 2.
    
    Lastly, if the Alarm state is triggered and on (1), you can
    un-trigger the alarm by disarming it via this option.
    
    You will then be returned to the main menu.
        
        Summary: Changes alarm and sensor status
        
6) PANIC!
    Much like option 2, this option is only available if the
    alarm is currently armed. Once armed, this option allows 
    one to set the alarm state to 1, which will "sound the 
    alarms", triggering the buzzer as well as the emergency 
    lights mode (with the help of some imaginationat the moment).
    
    To disable panic mode, or turn the alarm state back to 0,
    you must disarm the alarm through Option 5, in which case
    you will be prompted to re-enter the passcode before you
    are able to disactivate the buzzer and lights.
    
    The alarm state is shown at the bottom of the main menu in 
    case you can't imagine the flashing lights and screaming
    siren when the alarm state is set to 1.   
    
        Summary: Triggers the alarm!
        
7) Help!
    Well, you're already here! Hopefully this option has done
    it's job and informed you on all the features of HADES!
    Enjoy your stay...
